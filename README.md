# My Solidity NFT Learning Project

This repository documents my journey learning Solidity and Foundry through the Cyfrin Updraft Advanced Foundry Course. Special thanks to [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC) for creating an incredible learning resource, and to [Engrpips](https://github.com/Engrpips) for their invaluable help with test implementations.



## ðŸš€ My Learning Journey

In this project, I'm exploring the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by creating two different types of NFTs:

1. An IPFS Hosted NFT 
2. An SVG NFT (Hosted 100% on-chain)

## Prerequisites

To follow along with my learning path, you'll need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/foundry-nft-learning
cd foundry-nft-learning
forge install
forge build
```

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understand NFT creation mechanisms
- Learn Solidity smart contract development
- Explore Foundry testing and deployment techniques
- Implement on-chain and IPFS-based NFT strategies

## Usage Commands

```bash
# Start a local blockchain node
make anvil

# Deploy contracts
make deploy

# Run tests
forge test

# Check test coverage
forge coverage
```

## Deployment to Testnet

1. Set up environment variables in `.env`
2. Get testnet ETH from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/)
3. Deploy your NFTs:

```bash
# IPFS NFT Deployment
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"

# SVG NFT Deployment
make deploySvg ARGS="--network sepolia"
```
